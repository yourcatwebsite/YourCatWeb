                <li><strong>Costs:</strong> Consider the financial responsibilities, including food, litter, grooming, and veterinary care.</li>

            <h2>Feeding Your Cat</h2>
            <p>Feeding your cat a balanced diet is essential for their health. Here are some tips:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High-Quality Food:</strong> Look for cat food that lists meat as the first ingredient. Avoid foods with excessive fillers.</li>
                <li><strong>Dry vs. Wet Food:</strong> Both have benefits. Wet food helps with hydration, while dry food can help keep teeth clean.</li>
                <li><strong>Special Dietary Needs:</strong> Some cats may require special diets based on health conditions. Consult your vet for advice.</li>
                <li><strong>Feeding Schedule:</strong> Establish a routine for feeding your cat. Most adult cats do well with two meals a day.</li>
                <li><strong>Treats:</strong> Use treats sparingly to avoid overfeeding, and choose healthy options.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>

                <li><strong>Spaying/Neutering:</strong> This prevents unwanted litters and can reduce certain health risks.</li>
                <li><strong>Grooming:</strong> Depending on the breed, regular brushing may be necessary to prevent matting and reduce shedding.</li>
                <li><strong>Dental Care:</strong> Consider dental treats or brushing your cat’s teeth to maintain oral health.</li>
                <li><strong>Watch for Symptoms:</strong> Be aware of changes in behavior, eating habits, or litter box use, as these can indicate health issues.</li>
